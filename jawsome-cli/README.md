# jawsome-cli

A CLI wrapper for transforming JSON data as configured in pipelines in
jawsome-dsl.

## Usage

This library boils down to the `def-cli-pipeline` macro.

`def-cli-pipeline` takes a jawsome-dsl pipeline, and defines a main
 function which dispatches to the appropriate pipeline function. To
 make that the 'active' pipeline for a given project, set the
 namespace where it's defined to be the :main namespace in your
 project.clj.

For example, if your pipeline is defined in namespace
jawsome-pipeline-searchpro.core, you would add
  `:main jawsome-pipeline-searchpro.core`
to the project.clj for jawsome-pipeline-searchpro and run
  `lein uberjar`
to generate jawsome-pipeline-searchpro-x.y.z-standalone.jar.

Then, you could invoke individual pipeline phases with the following:
  `java -jar /path/to/jawsome-pipeline-searchpro-x.y.z-standalone.jar denorm` (*1)
  `java -jar /path/to/jawsome-pipeline-searchpro-x.y.z-standalone.jar schema` (*2)
  `java -jar /path/to/jawsome-pipeline-searchpro-x.y.z-standalone.jar project` (*3)
and you could invoke an overall pipeline with the following:
  `cat foo.js |
      *1 | tee denorm.js |
      *2 > schema.clj ;
      *3 denorm.js schema.clj > project.xsv`

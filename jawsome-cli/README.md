# jawsome-cli

A CLI wrapper for transforming JSON data as configured in jawsome-dsl pipelines.

## How to require it

Add these dependencies to your `project.clj`:

```clj
[com.onekingslane.danger/jawsome-cli "1.0.0"]
[com.onekingslane.danger/jawsome-dsl "1.0.0"]
```

These will allow you to make the following requires:

```clj
(:require [jawsome-cli.core :refer [def-cli-pipeline]])
(:require [jawsome-dsl.xform :refer [defxform devar]])
```

## Usage

This library boils down to the `def-cli-pipeline`
macro. `def-cli-pipeline` takes a jawsome-dsl pipeline s-expression,
and turns it into a `(defn -main ...)` which dispatches to the
appropriate pipeline function. To make that the 'active' pipeline for
a given project, you need to do two things:

1. set the namespace where it's defined to be the `:main` namespace
   in your project.clj.
2. add a `(:gen-class)` directive to the namespace where it's
   defined.

For example, if your pipeline is defined in namespace
jawsome-pipeline-searchpro.core, you would add `:main
jawsome-pipeline-searchpro.core` to the project.clj for
jawsome-pipeline-searchpro, and add `(:gen-class)` to the ns-macro at
the top of jawsome-pipeline-searchpro.core.

Then you could run

    $ lein uberjar

to generate jawsome-pipeline-searchpro-x.y.z-standalone.jar, which
would let you invoke individual pipeline phases with the following:

  `java -jar /path/to/jawsome-pipeline-searchpro-x.y.z-standalone.jar denorm` (*1)
  `java -jar /path/to/jawsome-pipeline-searchpro-x.y.z-standalone.jar schema` (*2)
  `java -jar /path/to/jawsome-pipeline-searchpro-x.y.z-standalone.jar project` (*3)

or you could invoke an overall pipeline with the following:

    $  cat foo.js |
    $      *1 | tee denorm.js |
    $      *2 > schema.clj ;
    $      *3 denorm.js schema.clj > project.xsv
